Why DevOps
To understand why DevOps is required, let’s first understand, what happens without DevOps.
while initiating a new project, we have two different kinds of teams. First is the Development team, which is involved completely in developing and testing, including writing code and unit test cases. The other team is the Operations team which is involved in operating and monitoring the product.
✔ Without DevOps, both teams (Development and Operations) work completely in an isolated manner.
✔ If DevOps is not there then the team spends most of the time in building the code and deploying on multiple
environments.
✔ Each team waits for others to be done. This means, if development is going on then the testing team waits for the deployment of the code (Artifact) on the QA environment and in the same manner the operations team waits for the deployment on the Production environment. So, due to this, a large amount of time gets wasted.
✔ As a human being, we make mistakes. Every time, building the code and deploying on specific environments in a manual fashion can increase the issues and resolving it will take a lot of time. Rather than doing it manually, we can make it automated using DevOps.

So, the above points show that we face lots of human issues and system issues if we are not following DevOps. Now, let’s see how we can make it more systematic using DevOps and how DevOps helps us to achieve the same tasks in less time without any errors.
✔ DevOps increases the higher success rate of new releases without any error.
✔ It helps us to simplify the whole development and deployment process.
✔ Automates the manual process like build process, release process, etc.
✔ Automates executing the test cases.
✔ Configures the continuous delivery and continuous deployment in the release cycle.
✔ Live monitoring.
✔ It also helps in team collaboration.
✔ Reduces the failures and rollbacks
✔ Provides continuous improvement
